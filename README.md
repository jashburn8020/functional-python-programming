Examples from Functional Python Programming by Steven F. Lott

These examples are written as pytest 3 test cases. To run them, you can either:
- `pytest-3 testfile`
- `chmod 755 testfile`, and then `./testfile` if pytest is available at `/usr/bin/pytest-3` (or change the test files' shebang to match the location of pytest)
